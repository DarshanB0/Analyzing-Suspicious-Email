#  Analysing Suspicious Email 

## Task Objective

The goal of this task was to **analyze a suspicious email** using a **public email header analyzer** to:
- Understand the structure of an email header
- Identify signs of spam or phishing
- Check if the email was spoofed or forged
- Learn to trace the route an email takes to reach the inbox


## Tools Used
- **MXToolbox Email Header Analyzer**  
  [https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx](https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx)

- **ChatGPT**  
  Used to generate a sample spam-like email header for analysis and learning purposes

Result :
 - Suspicious links or attachments
   1. Link: http://paypal-login-secure-help.com/verify
   2. paypal.com is not the real domain
   
 - Urget or Threatening Language
   1. ‚ÄúYour account has been limited!‚Äù
      ‚ÄúYou must verify your account within 24 hours to avoid permanent suspension.‚Äù
      
 - Mismatched URLs
   1. Display text: ‚ÄúClick here to verify your account‚Äù
   2. Real URL: http://paypal-login-secure-help.com/verify
      hovering would show the real link
      --- doesn‚Äôt match the real PayPal domain
      
 - Spelling or Grammar Errors
   1. Spelling is okay, but a real PayPal email would use:
	Better formatting
	Proper branding
	Personalized greeting like ‚ÄúHello (username)‚Äù
